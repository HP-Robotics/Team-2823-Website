Team-2823-Website
=================

The website for the FRC 2823 robotics team (http://www.highland-2823.com)!

The website is a mixuture of Bootstrap 3.0.3 and WordPress 3.8, all built from scratch. The WordPress now exists in the root, but there are also some static pages in root as well.

Anyone can modify the site, and if you want to code for it you need to:

1. Fork this repository
2. Make your changes on your forked repository (Hopefully fixing issues)
3. Make a pull request
4. We'll accept the code change if you made some sort of contribution

**IMPORTANT:** If you wish to edit the WordPress theme, go to wp-content/themes/bootstrap-theme and edit the php there. If you want to edit the navbar or the footer, edit the navbar.shtml and the footer.shtml in the root.
